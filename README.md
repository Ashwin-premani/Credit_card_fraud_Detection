🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection
Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection - Kaggle

📖 Overview
This project builds an efficient classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
The dataset is highly imbalanced, so specialized techniques are applied to ensure high fraud detection rates while minimizing false positives.

🛠️ Steps Followed
1. Data Preprocessing
Checked for missing values

Created Scaled Amount feature

Engineered new features:

Transaction frequency by user

Spending patterns based on time

Location mismatch indicators (if available)

2. Handling Class Imbalance
Techniques used:

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

Random Undersampling

Combination strategies

3. Model Building
Models trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

(Optional) Neural Networks

Performed hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

4. Model Evaluation
Focused on Recall, Precision, and F1-Score

Plotted ROC-AUC Curves

Analyzed Confusion Matrix to minimize false positives

📈 Results
✅ Achieved a strong balance between recall and precision.
✅ Selected the best model based on minimizing false positives while maintaining high detection accuracy.
